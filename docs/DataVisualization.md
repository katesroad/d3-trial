# Data Visualization

## Design Principles

### [Five second rule](https://www.educative.io/courses/introduction-to-visualization-using-d3-js/gxVk8X2pyO6#Five-second-rule)

The first rule of thumb when it comes to data visualization principle is the five-second rule. It means that the chart should answer the important question about the data at a glance, i.e., five seconds. If a chart is taking longer to convey the information, then there is likely a problem with the chart selection or design.

### Selection of the right chart

- **Line charts** display trends and can be used to display continuous data over time.
- **Bar charts** are used to compare data between different groups over time.
- **Pie charts** are used to show proportions of the whole data and is more intuitive when used for percentages.
- **Scatter charts** are used to show the relationship between data.
- **Treemaps** are used to display hierarchical data.

### Color Selection

- The general rule is that we should not use more than 6-7 colors in one layout.
- We should not use red colors for positive values and green color for negative values.
- There should be sufficient contrast between two colors, e.g., using green and light green color in the same layout will cause confusion, and it will be hard to tell the difference.
